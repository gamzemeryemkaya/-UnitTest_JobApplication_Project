# Unit Testing -Job Application Project

I am writing a function in this project that automatically evaluates job applications received by a company.


## Project Screenshots // Summary

##### The function measures the application along with parameters such as the technologies used by the applicant and their experience, and returns a result. The result options include direct rejection of the application, forwarding it to human resources, forwarding it to a team leader, forwarding it to the CTO, or automatic acceptance.

##### The purpose of this project is to perform unit tests on the evaluate method. This follows the "unit of work" principle, which is a fundamental concept for unit testing. The function receives an application form from outside and tests how it should behave based on the parameters included in the form.

##### The test project consists of three sections: arrange, action, and assert. In the arrange section, settings are made, an action is taken in the action section, and checks are made in the assert section.
